## Unsolved Problems
- The main unsolved problem is the total balance for both your incpme and expenses

## Future Enhancements
- Work in progress: Adding a balance total to the top of the page and totals of expenses and income on the respective pages
- Include a way to have the user log in
- Incorporate an "edit" button to be able to change the amount of the transaction
